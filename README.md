# CROwler

CROwler is a simple web crawler which is able to scrape user comments at [index](http://www.index.hr/indexforum) forum. The idea behind the project spawned at [TakeLab](http://takelab.fer.hr), a research group based at the University of Zagreb, which specializes in NLP and aims to use CROwler to extract user generated content for future projects.
